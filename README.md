## Vagrant

Vagrant Allows us to describe what kind of server we need for our app.
We can then save the config as a vagrant file, which allows us to reproduce and share the same server with other developers.
After this it will use Virtual Machines to create virtual servers exactly as we described.
This means our requirements have been installed and running on a virtual server completely in an isolated environment.

### Advantages

- Easy to share the server with others
- Exact the same version of all requirements
- Run exactly the same software as a real production server
- Easily create and destroy the server as needed

## Vagrant vs Docker

| Docker                            | Vagrant                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Open Source Containerization tool | Manage Virtual Development Environments     |
| run app in light weight images    | No out-of-the-box virtualization technology |

Vagrant are easier to learn than docker.
